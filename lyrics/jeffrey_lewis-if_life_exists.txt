I think if life exists
It's probably like this
I had a common goal
I caught a common cold
I said when I get healthy
I won't take it for granted
And I really thought I meant it but I knew when I got better that I'd probably forget it
Feeling fine wasn't worth a mention
So I didn't pay attention
And it seems that's just the way
Its all easier said that done
And it's not even easy to say
And when I get back home
I'll see what's left before I'd gone
A thousand sheets of paper
I'll see what they are later
And then I've gotta roam
And back and forth I've flown
And when I get back home I'll see what's left before I've gone
Two thousand sheets of paper
I'll see what they are later
Well it's hard to get too bored
When you pick the right two chords
And you keep on strumming
As if you don't know what's coming
Now I don't have a girlfriend and I wish I was more happy
Now I have a girlfriend and I wish I was more happy
Now I have two girlfriends and I wish I was more happy
Now I have four girlfriends and I wish I was more happy
And when I'm in an airplane
I close my eyes and pretend
That it's a rocket pointed straight down
Shooting at the earth again
Now I am more happy and I wish I was more happy
If I was a little smarter
If I worked a little harder
But emotions in the brain
They'll always be the same
It's just chemicals and blob
And what you've got is what you've got
And you just apply it to whatever's passing by it
Just like the guitar pick that I could not keep in my grip
It's like all the love I lose 'cos I could never fill the shoes
But it's just because I have no feet
And then I think every minute of every day I have a choice
To wish things could be better or be glad things aren't be worse
And maybe every minute of every day we have the choice
To say, "Things could be better, " or to say, "Things could be worse."
And I think if life exists
It's probably like this
But it's hard to get too bored
When you pick the right two chords
And you keep on strumming
As if you don't know what's coming
And it seems that's just the way
It's all easier said that done
And it's not even easy to say
