It they pull you under, you're buried alive
Don't wait for an answer cos no-one survived
If you now that it's a force of habit
Take something from it
You called, it came
It's here to stay
These wounds don't heel but the won't show
They've already been out there
They been walking for miles
There's nobody out there
So don't waste your time
It's over a choice that you made
It's taken you nowhere
You called, they came
They're here to stay
I've seen it form your side but
Still takes a moment to realise
These situations they often arise
They say it's impossible to know but I know, keep my head low
Decide on it once and for all, so now you know
They say it's impossible to grow, but I grown, read the head stone
Confides in it once and for all
You know that it's a force of habit
Take something from it
You called, they came
They're here to stay
I'm seeing it from both sides but
I need the moment to understand why these situations always arise
I've seen it with my own eyes but
Still takes a moment to realise why
These situations they often arise
Been bitten, still too shy or
One thing or another but no one ask why
These complications get me tied
I've seen it with my own eyes but
Still takes a moment to realise why
These situations they often arise
Been bitten twice as shy or
One thing or another that no-one ask why
These complications get me tied
I've seen it all with my own eyes but
Still takes a moment to realise why
These situations they often arise
