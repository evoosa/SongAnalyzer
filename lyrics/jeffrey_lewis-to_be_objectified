I left a trail of myself every place that I have been through
And going bald is the most manly thing that I'm ever gonna do
I tell the earth, "thanks for the hair, thanks for the skin, thanks for the bone"
Though I now slowly give it back I still appreciate the loan
Just tell me that you like me in the same sentence as a mountain side
'Cause it would be such a relief to be objectified
'Cause who says it's so important to sort through these thoughts of ours
Maybe be that's why we love to try to see ourselves from the outside
In photographs and videos and diaries and mirrors
'Cause it would be such a relief to be objectified
And the closest that I ever got still seems to leave a lot to go
But the horizon seems to be a place that nobody can know
Looking forth and looking back, our vision can't extend beyond the quaint vanishing points our bodies' recommend
And I'll help you move some furniture somewhere it's never been before, but the room's so small the dresser drawer won't let us get back out the door
Just tell me that you like me in the same sentence as the building
It would be such a relief to...
I'm just a natural thing
We're only boats
And the boats are only empty
And you can't blame an empty boat that's on a river to the sea
You can't blame a billion boats without a sail, without a sailor
And that's how we look in photographs, and diaries, and mirrors
And the plants turn into ants, and the ants turn into plants
And children are clumsy people, and old people are rotting Children
And I still don't have a cell phone, but this sea shell gets Reception
And the ocean won't stop calling, and I want a restraining order
Just tell me that you like me in the same sentence as a building
It would be such a relief to see I'm just a natural thing
We're just a natural thing
Just like anything
