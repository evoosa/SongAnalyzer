How do I word this verse
So much work at first, it goes
How should I walk this earth?
So much worse the further, the further you go
Go, take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
And keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell'em what you know
But all that you know, though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought
But you're managing, that's how you evened out
Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between a wrong and a right
You get yours, I'm gonna get mine
Is that what you signed for?
They're feeding you lies
To keep you on their side
It works every time
What you got to live for
Now you got the whole of the world at your feet
And how much more can you pass yourself round?
What you got to live for now
You got the whole of the world at your feet
But you're still shaking?
You need to make up some ground
Go, take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
And keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell'em what you know
But all that you know, though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought
But you're managing, that's how you evened out
