You're here, but won't be for long
Just 'til that certain song
It set you off
Heart is broken
They won't ever stop
I don't wanna know
I suppose where you are
Don't go far
They've told us all
Both know that's hard
Don't go, don't go far
Just leave me alone
Mind of mine
You waste my time
I'm not taking steps anymore that size
I don't need to know
I suppose where you are
But don't go far
We should try to let go
Even though it's hard
But don't go, don't go far
Here, but won't be for long
Just 'til that certain song comes on
I don't wanna know
I suppose where you are
But don't go far
We should try to let go
Even though it's hard
But don't go, don't go far
I don't wanna know
I suppose where you are
But don't go far
We should try to let go
Even though it's hard
Just go, but don't go far
